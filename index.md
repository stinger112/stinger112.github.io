## Professional preferences and interests

- **remote** or **hybrid** work is preferred. Ability to work on-site is also considered.

- Working on scientific projects with scientists makes thinking more flexible. Different views give rise to new approaches. 
- Trying out new technologies, concepts, architectures, fields and domains is critical to the evolution of a system.
- The solution may look weird, but often the reason lies in the misunderstanding or ignorance of the beholder.
- Loosely coupled / decentralized / mesh designs are prefered.
- Well-established QA process and proper testing is crucial.
- Security policies should not just be reviewed, but tested to show how serious it is.

- Aesthetic minimalism.
- Open source / open AI ideology. Companies should contribute, not just use.
- The dev process can be extraordinary improved by using AI tools. Knowledge of these technologies becomes professional requirement.

- Knowledge should be transferred periodically, with mandatory testing to ensure that others can maintain the system.
- Review the code of related projects to avoid integration surprises.
- More training of explanation / pesentation skills even for tech specialists.

- Functional programming approaches is appreciated.
- Use literature code style. Docs and APIs should be automatically generated.
- All documents should lie in one and only one place. All additional diagrams and drafts should be in the same place.

- Periodically review others projects to see overall picture and make informed proposals.


## My professional principles
### Development
- If some person doesn't finish something, his colleague will have to do it, but with more time and effort.
- The task can be considered as done if and only if it's covered by at least one e2e test.
- Every PR has to be reviewed by peer. The peer becomes responsible for missed bugs and fix them.
- The proper QA process can take up to 30% of the work time. But it's not something you can save money on by simply clicking the “Approve” button.

### Communication
- If speaker presents something important or strategic, they must provide materials in advance and test the audience for understanding in the end.
- The more people involved in the discussion, the more it costs the company. So, prior preparation and a strict moderator are crucial.
- Long or complex discussions always need breaks. The main goal is to get a good understanding, otherwise it's just the waste of time.
- If the topic is completely unclear, just stop it and ask for introductory material.
